#This is a file contianing all the database types used by BaconMap.  Feel free to add
#your own.  The structure is pretty simple, any line prefaced by a pound sign (#)
#is a comment and will be ignored by the program.  Any other line will be read
#and included in any role related drop down boxes or other role specific parts of
#the program.  This includes any blank lines, so it recommended that no blank
#lines are included in this file.

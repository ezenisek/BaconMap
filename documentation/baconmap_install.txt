You will require the following before BaconMap can be installed:
- A computer running webserver software such as Apache(Linux) or IIS(Windows)
	- The webserver will need to support PHP, and have PHP installed
	- BaconMap was tested under PHP 5.X.
	- Other versions are not currently supported, but may work.
- A MySQL database for BaconMap or use
- Ability to edit file permissions in the BaconMap folders

In addition, you'll need to install GraphViz on the same server as BaconMap will go
if you wish to use BaconMap's mapping and flowcharting functions.  GraphViz is an 
Open Source package, and can be found at http://www.graphviz.org.  The following
instructions are for setting up GraphViz.  If you have any questions or need further
assistance, including installing for Windows, please visit the GraphViz Website.


To install GraphViz (Linux):

1. Download the latest GraphViz source
	- http://www.graphviz.org/Download_source.php
	- Save it to a temporary location

2. Untar this file:
    	- tar xzvf /tmp/graphviz-xxx.tar.gz (replace xxx with your version number)
    	- This command will extract sources to a new directory created
          within the current directory with the name of the package and version

3. Run the following to compile and install GraphViz:
	- cd into the new directory
	- ./configure
	- make
	- make install

4. Delete the installation directory:
	- cd ../;rm -r graphviz-xxx /tmp/graphviz-xxx.tar.gz

If all went well, GraphViz should be installed and ready to use.



To install BaconMap:

1. Unzip or UnTar the appropriate file to your webserver where BaconMap will reside.
	- You can install BaconMap anywhere you like, but the file structure inside 
	  the BaconMap directory must remain intact.

2. Set the following files or directories to be writable by the PHP user:
	- /logs and all subdirectories
	- /image
	- /includes/settings.php
	- /includes/roles.txt
	- /includes/dbtypes.txt
	- /includes/ostypes.txt
	- /includes/poctypes.txt
	- /uploads

3. Setup your database for BaconMap to use
	- BaconMap will need a database and a database user to access it.
	- We recommend you give BaconMap its own user and restrict access to only
	  the BaconMap database.
	- The BaconMap installation program will create all the needed tables and 
	  fields in the database when it runs for the first time.

4. Once everything is set, open your browser and browse to the 
   BaconMap Directory on your server.  The setup script should run automatically.
   Follow the instructions there and your BaconMap installation should be complete.
